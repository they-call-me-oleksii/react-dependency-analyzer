# React Dependancy Analizer

## Motivation

I started to work on this extention to address my painpoints - the react components that 1k+ lines of code and has a bunch of hooks inside of them...
`useMemo`s, `useEffect`s, `useCalback`s. JUST use`MYASS` already

So, this extention helps visualize all this mess to make a refactoring less painfull for you.
